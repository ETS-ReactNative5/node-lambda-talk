# An analysis of node lambda deployment tools

Up for analysis:

 * CloudFormation (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
 * Serverless Application Model (SAM) (https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model)
 * Terraform (https://www.terraform.io/)
 * Serverless Framework (https://serverless.com/)
 * Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/)
 * Claudia.js (https://claudiajs.com/)
 * ZEIT's Now (https://zeit.co/now)

Others? (worthy mentions?):

 * Apex (https://apex.run/)
 * Up (https://github.com/apex/up)
 * Architect (https://arc.codes/)
 * faast.js (https://faastjs.org/)

## Considerations for discussion

 * Vendor lock-in ( https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/06/coreos_kubernetes_v_world/ https://lumigo.io/blog/you-are-wrong-about-serverless-vendor-lock-in/ )
 * Maturity/ opinionated/ customizable/ cloud agnostic/ cost/ configuration based or configuration free/ focused on what AWS resources you can configure?
